# Piano Phase Visualizer

## Project Overview

This is an interactive web application designed to visualize **Steve Reich's minimalist composition, Piano Phase (1967)**. It aims to demonstrate the phasing process with synchronized audio and music notation, allowing users to observe the complex rhythmic patterns that emerge as the two voices gradually move out of sync.

The interface features controls for tempo, phasing speed, instrument timbre, and a unique "Auditory Density" meter that quantifies the rhythmic irregularity of the acoustic result.
